            As I was reading “Web Work, A History of Internet Art” I couldn’t help but to think how progressive the term “net.art” is. “Net.Art stands for communications and graphics, email, texts and images, referring to and merging into one another; it was artists, enthusiasts…” (Greene, 162) this exact definition reminded me of the fashion, beauty and lifestyle blogs that are so popular today as well as sites like Reddit and Twitter. Toward the end of the article, Greene speaks with I/O/D member Simon Pope about the decision to develop software, he replies, “we tried to expand on the idea of “software as culture”. Upon reading this line, I thought of Apple. Apple is everywhere and probably the most leading software in the world. Apple today is definitely a “software as culture.” </p>

        Upon reading “With Galleries Closed, a Moment for Net Artists to Shine '' I thought of how the pandemic brought to light a lot of things that were going on in society. Digital artwork by net-artists such as Olia Lialina was not the only thing the pandemic shed light on, the imbalance of the United States educational system was seen too. Though this article isn’t about the pandemic and the effects it’s had on society the principle remains - the invisible is now visible, the underground is now on ground, the things that were happening in the small corners of society are now at the center. For example, two teens, Eva and Franco Mattes who founded cat memes. Who would’ve thought memes would have been so popular. </p>
