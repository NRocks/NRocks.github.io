            In episode 1, of John Berger’s “Ways of Seeing,” I appreciated his allusion to videography. Berger states because paintings are silent and still, paintings lend themselves to easy manipulation.. the most obvious way of manipulating them is through movement and sound” (Berger, ep. 01). There are several mediums for publicity such as print ads or television in this day and age but videography takes first place. Also, Berger mentions “words you notice consciously, music is subtler, it can work almost without your noticing it” (Berger, ep. 01), this serves as another reference into how video is made today. Videography also serves as an effective vehicle for publicity. When Berger says at the end of episode 01 “... you receive images and meanings which are arranged, I hope you will consider what I arrange and be skeptical of it.” Bergers' statement reminded me of propaganda and how propaganda’s main objective is to illicit a response, a reaction out of the masses. In propaganda, words and images are twisted and manipulated and we live in a nation where skepticism is at an all-time high and here Berger is telling us to be skeptical dating all the way back to the early 1970s. </p>

        In the last segment of John Berger’s “Ways of Seeing” he focuses on publicity and the nature of publicity. He mentions “publicity proposes to each of us in a consumer society that we change ourselves or our lives by buying something more, this “more” will make us in some way richer even though we will be poorer by having spent our money.” I found this statement by Berger’s to be illuminating given the way the world is going today. In another course that I am taking this semester, it was mentioned how we are living in a day and age where a lot of people are striving to be something that isn’t real, especially with the rise of social media and people like The Kardashians.
